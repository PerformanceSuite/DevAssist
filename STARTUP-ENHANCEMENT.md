# Session Startup Enhancement - No More "What would you like to focus on?"

## Problem Solved
After starting a session with DevAssist, Claude was asking open-ended questions like "What would you like to focus on today?" instead of being actionable. This wastes the context that was just loaded and defeats the purpose of the warm-up.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `startup-enhancer.js`
A new module that automatically:
- Performs warm-up
- Queries sprint status from DevAssist database
- Checks git for uncommitted changes
- Identifies blocked tasks
- Shows in-progress work
- **Provides concrete next actions, not questions**

### 2. Enhanced Session Report Structure

Instead of questions, the session now starts with:

```
üìã Current Sprint Status

üö® BLOCKED ITEMS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:
  ‚ùå API Authentication
     Blockers: Missing OAuth credentials
     ‚Üí Action: Resolve these blockers first

üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Continue these:
  ‚Ä¢ Dashboard implementation - Frontend 60% complete
  ‚Ä¢ User settings page

‚ö†Ô∏è Uncommitted Changes Detected:
  Branch: feat/dashboard
  Modified files:
    ‚Ä¢ src/components/Dashboard.tsx
    ‚Ä¢ src/api/client.ts
  ‚Üí Action: Review and commit these changes

üìç Next Actions:
1. Unblock: API Authentication
2. Commit: Review and commit the 2 modified files
```

### 3. Priority-Based Action System

The system now prioritizes actions in this order:
1. **BLOCKED items** - These need immediate attention
2. **Uncommitted changes** - Clean up work in progress
3. **In-progress tasks** - Continue active work
4. **New tasks** - Start something new only if nothing else is pending

### 4. Updated Slash Commands

All session commands now emphasize actionable output:
- `/session-start` - Starts with sprint status, not questions
- `/sprint-status` - New command for checking sprint any time
- `/session-checkpoint` - Saves progress
- `/session-end` - Preserves context for next session

## How It Works

When you type `/session-start`:

1. **Warm-up runs** (loads context, analyzes changes, etc.)
2. **Sprint status queries** run automatically
3. **Git status** is checked
4. **Priorities are calculated** based on blocked/in-progress/new tasks
5. **Actionable report generated** with specific next steps
6. **No questions asked** - just clear direction on what to do next

## Benefits

- **No wasted context** - The loaded information is immediately used
- **Clear direction** - You know exactly what to work on
- **Priority-driven** - Most important tasks surface first
- **Git-aware** - Uncommitted changes are highlighted
- **Sprint-focused** - Shows the current sprint state

## Testing

After restarting Claude, when you use `/session-start`, you'll see:
- Warm-up metrics
- Current sprint status with blocked/active/pending tasks
- Git status if there are uncommitted changes
- **Concrete next actions** instead of "What would you like to focus on?"

## Configuration

The startup enhancer is now part of the DevAssist core and will:
- Automatically activate with warm-up
- Query your project's progress tracking
- Check git status
- Generate actionable reports

No additional configuration needed!
