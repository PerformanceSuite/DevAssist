## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Protocol**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) via stdio
- **Storage**: JSON files for simplicity and portability
- **Language**: Node.js with ES6 modules
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)

### Future Database Strategy

#### Phase 1: JSON Storage (Current)
- Simple file-based storage
- Easy backup and migration
- No external dependencies
- Suitable for small to medium projects

#### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (Planned)
